🚀 **Tired of digging through endless folders in SharePoint?**

I'm excited to share a new open-source **Document Listing Web Part** I've been working on! It transforms standard document libraries into a modern, navigated dashboard.

**Key Features:**
🔹 **Dual Navigation**: Filter by Category & Sub-Category instantly.
🔹 **Better UX**: Clean, paginated interface that fits right into your site theme.
🔹 **Access Control**: Built-in "Request Access" workflow that tracks requests in a separate list.

It's amazing how much a good UI can improve user adoption and productivity. This web part solves the "where is that policy?" problem once and for all.

Check out the code and deployment guide here: [Link to Repository]
